# Simple url shortener service using Python and Redis

TODO: Write a project description

## Usage

A varied implementation of url shortener service of my own, rather than piggy-backing on other reputable url shortener service such as Bitly/TinyURL etc. This is for my educational/hobby purposes. 

## History

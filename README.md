# Simple url shortener service using Python and Redis

## Usage

A varied implementation of url shortener service of my own, rather than piggy-backing on other reputable url shortener services such as Bitly/TinyURL etc. 

In short, I'm just doing this for passionate fun.

## History

TODO: Write history

## TODOS
1. Base64 encoding or decodings
2. Use Redis for storing key/value pairs for each urls parsed
3. Also use redis to store every accessed shortened url in the redis database
4. Add a trivial unit testing script for the url service

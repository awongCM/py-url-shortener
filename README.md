# Simple url shortener service using Python and Redis

## Usage

A varied implementation of url shortener service of my own, rather than piggy-backing on other reputable url shortener services such as Bitly/TinyURL etc.

In short, I'm just doing this for passionate fun.

## History

Ver 1.0: Implemented URL Shortener Service using Python and Redis, included Base64 encodings for string-based urls; 

## TODOS

1. ~~Implement Base64 encoding/decoding for shortened urls~~
2. ~~Use Redis for storing key/value pairs for each shortened url parsed~~
3. ~~Also use redis to store every accessed shortened url in the redis database~~
4. Add a trivial unit testing script.
5. Convert this tool into actual service using Flask.
